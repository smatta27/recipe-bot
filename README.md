## Project Description

  * As college students who struggle to make meals and can find recipes in an easy way. We think this project will be helpful to those who are very busy such as college students.
  * This idea is also very unique because we are implementing AI into something simple such as a cook book we are combining new technology into something that has been popular for a very long time.
 * For this project we plan on using Python for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend. We plan on using Visual Studio Code and Github.
   
* Chatbot features:
  
  * if users are unsure on what they want to cook they can click a chatbot button at the bottom of the home page
  * users can enter specific ingredients they currently have and based on that the ai chat bot can provide different food options
  * users can also enter flavors they are craving and based on that the ai chat bot can provide different food options
  * API; we are incorporating a chat gpt API for the custom input for the chatbot.
  * there is a nav bar with login/signup/signout

* This is what the folders in the vs code has to look like so it would properly run. All html files have to be umder templates folder and the css files under the static folder. Lastly, the chatbot.py should be outside of these two folders like shown above.
